# MessengerVisualisation
Building a system to visualise data from Facebook Messenger.

## Project aims

For many people, Facebook messages represent a significant portion of online communication, especially with Messenger's support for large groups. But the linear structure of chats can make it difficult to track information about a chat as a whole - for instance, the most frequent commenters, or people who frequently engage with each other within the chat. My aim is to make it easier to visualise this sort of information, share it with friends, and potentially better understand the social dynamics of large groups.

In terms of scope, I'm mainly working on this during winter 2019, for something to do that's reasonably relaxing during the vacation period.

## Obtaining data

You can obtain information from any Messenger chats you're part of, directly from Facebook:

* While logged into your Facebook account, head to the top right, click the little arrow, and click 'Settings'.
* Click 'Your Facebook information' on the lest sidebar, and then 'Download your information' in the middle menu.
* You'll see a list of pieces of information you can receive. If you just want messages, click 'Deselect all', then check 'Messages'.
* In the series of dropdown boxes, make sure you change format from HTML to JSON. You may also want to change media quality if you want to save space.
* It can take a few hours or days to receive a copy of your messages, and the file is quite large (about 6GB when compressed).
